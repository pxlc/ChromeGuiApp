# ChromeGuiApp open source project

The goal of this project is to allow for the fast creation of attractive, dynamic, and responsive Desktop apps, by leveraging the power of Python (and the access to all of the many powerful Python libraries that are available) under the hood, and by taking advantage of the wealth of open source web-front-end libraries (CSS & JavaScript frameworks and toolkits) to deliver GUIs through a Chrome or Chromium browser.

A strong secondary goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-work-with framework/library that has a very small number of dependencies, and that is simple to set up and use.

All you need is Python 2.7.x or 3.x.x and the Chrome (or Chromium) browser installed. You will also need to install the **`jinja`** Python package into your install of Python.


## Highlights

* No dependency on non-built-in Python packages (examples provided require `jinja2`)
* Supported for Python 2.7 and Python 3.x (and may actually work for Python 2.6 ... just haven't tried it yet)
* Tested in Python 2.7.15 and Python 3.7.0 (and only tested on Windows 10 so far)

## Requirements

* Python 2.7 or Python 3.x
* Chrome Browser installed
* jinja2 python package installed (to run examples)
