Websocket Server
=======================

A minimal Websockets Server in Python with no external dependencies.

  * Works with Python2 and Python3
  * Clean simple API
  * Multiple clients
  * No dependencies
  
Notice that this implementation does not support the more advanced features
like SSL etc. The project is focused mainly on making it easy to run a
websocket server for prototyping, testing or for making a GUI for your application.


License
=======================
MIT open source license. Project found at: https://github.com/Pithikos/python-websocket-server


Usage
=======================
You can get a feel of how to use the websocket server by running

    python server.py
    
Then just open `client.html` in your browser and you should be able to send and receive messages.


Using in your project
=======================
You can either simply copy/paste the *websocket_server.py* file in your project and use it directly
or you can install the project directly from PyPi:

    pip install websocket-server

For coding details have a look at the [*server.py*](https://github.com/Pithikos/python-websocket-server/blob/master/server.py) example and the [API](https://github.com/Pithikos/python-websocket-server#api).


API
=======================

The API is simply methods and properties of the `WebsocketServer` class.

## WebsocketServer

The WebsocketServer takes two arguments: a `port` and a `hostname`.
By default `localhost` is used. However if you want to be able and connect
to the server from the network you need to pass `0.0.0.0` as hostname.

###Properties

| Property | Description          |
|----------|----------------------|
| clients  | A list of `client`   |


###Methods

| Method                      | Description                                                                           | Takes           | Gives |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| `set_fn_new_client()`       | Sets a callback function that will be called for every new `client` connecting to us  | function        | None  |
| `set_fn_client_left()`      | Sets a callback function that will be called for every `client` disconnecting from us | function        | None  |
| `set_fn_message_received()` | Sets a callback function that will be called when a `client` sends a message          | function        | None  |
| `send_message()`            | Sends a `message` to a specific `client`. The message is a simple string.             | client, message | None  |
| `send_message_to_all()`     | Sends a `message` to **all** connected clients. The message is a simple string.       | message         | None  |


###Callback functions

| Set by                      | Description                                       | Parameters              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `set_fn_new_client()`       | Called for every new `client` connecting to us    | client, server          |
| `set_fn_client_left()`      | Called for every `client` disconnecting from us   | client, server          |
| `set_fn_message_received()` | Called when a `client` sends a `message`          | client, server, message |


The client passed to the callback is the client that left, sent the message, etc. The server might not have any use to use. However it is
passed in case you want to send messages to clients.


Example:
````
from websocket_server import WebsocketServer

def new_client(client, server):
	server.send_message_to_all("Hey all, a new client has joined us")

server = WebsocketServer(13254)
server.set_fn_new_client(new_client)
server.run_forever()
````

##Client

Client is just a dictionary passed along methods.

````
{
	'id'      : client_id,
	'handler' : client_handler,
	'address' : (addr, port)
}
````
